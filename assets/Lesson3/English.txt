Lisa:>Let's find an apartment downtown, in the shopping district!

Mary:>It would be expensive, polluted, and noisy. _
And it wouldn't be safe at night.

Lisa:>Oh, that's right. _
Hey, we could look out near Lakeview Park.

Mary:>That's a beautiful area. _
Is that neighborhood safe?

Lisa:>Yes, it is. _
And it's very clean and quiet.

Mary:>Is there good transportation there?

Lisa:>Sure. Lots of buses go by, and it's on the MRT line.

Mary:>Is it a convenient neighborhood?

Lisa:>Yes. There are lots of shops and a department store nearby.

Mary:>Well, I think that's the place we ought to look.
