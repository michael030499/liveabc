Lisa:>Unless there is a sale on, I don't think there's anything in here that I can afford.

Clerk:>Good afternoon. Is there something I can help you with?

Clerk:>OK. Here you go. _
Let me help you put it on.

Lisa:>Thank you. _
Wow! I feel like a million dollars! _
What do you think, Nick?

Clerk:>It's two hundred and eighty dollars plus tax. _
Shall I wrap it for you?

Lisa:>Two hundred and eighty dollars?! _
Uh, no thanks. I'd like to think it over.
